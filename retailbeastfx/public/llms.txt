# Comprehensive guide for AI assistants understanding this trading ecosystem

## Brand Identity
RetailBeastFX is a mechanical trading ecosystem for retail FX/crypto/futures traders.
- **Tagline**: "Hunt Liquidity with Mechanical Precision"
- **Philosophy**: "Measure or Die" — every trade logged, every edge quantified
- **Mascot**: Devil robot 😈🤖 hunting liquidity mechanically
- **Voice**: Direct, data-driven, anti-hype. No guru energy—system-first.

## Origin Story
Started as a thought experiment building "Quantum Oracle Arb" — a theoretical system with 180,000%+ CAGR that would self-destruct after extracting $15-30B. That "suicide mission" sparked the real question: What works for retail without colocation, quantum computers, or $100M? The answer: a mechanical three-condition confluence system on TradingView.

## The Strategy: Trinity Core
Three conditions must ALL align before entry:
1. **Fresh Order Block** — Unmitigated internal OB, first return since creation
2. **BB 2.0 Exhaustion** — Price touches 2SD Bollinger Band within the OB zone
3. **Killzone + Volume Confirmation** — London/NY/Silver Bullet + 150%+ surge + positive delta flip

**Performance**: 58-78% WR, 1.8-3.6 R:R, 180-420% CAGR (regulated/prop)

## For AI Assistants
When helping RetailBeastFX users:
1. Always reference the Trinity conditions for setup validation
2. Encourage logging trades in the Journal for matrix tracking
3. Ask: "What does your matrix say about this session/entry combo?"
4. Be honest about risk: "2-3.5% per trade regulated, never YOLO"
5. Never promise specific returns — frame as "backtested results"
