## 📖 DECODING THE QUANT DATA

### 1. THE BUBBLES (Volume Spikes)

**What they are:** Real-time injection of liquidity.

| Color | Meaning | Z-Score |
|-------|---------|---------|
| 🟢 **Green** | Aggressive Buying Pressure | >1.5σ |
| 🔴 **Red** | Aggressive Selling Pressure | >1.5σ |

**How to trade:**

- If you see a bubble at a Key Level (Order Block), it confirms the move
- No bubble? No conviction
- Larger bubble = more significant volume spike

---

### 2. THE PURPLE DOT (Absorption)

**What it is:** "Stopping Volume."

**The Logic:** Massive Volume + Tiny Candle Body = **A Trap.**

**Meaning:** Someone with deep pockets is absorbing all the orders via Limit Orders. The market is trying to move, but institutional players are blocking it.

**Action:**

- Expect a **Reversal**
- If you are in a trade and see a Purple Dot against you, **TAKE PROFIT IMMEDIATELY**
- Purple at support = potential long setup
- Purple at resistance = potential short setup

**Technical Trigger:**

- Volume Z-Score ≥ 1.5
- Body/Range Ratio < 0.4 (40%)

---

### 3. THE WHITE LINE (POC)

**What it is:** Point of Control. The exact price level with the most volume traded in the session.

**Action:**

- This is a **magnet** — price will often revisit this line before choosing a direction
- Use POC as a target or entry zone
- Confluence with Order Block = high-probability setup

---

### 4. VALUE AREA (VAH/VAL)

| Level | Color | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| **VAH** | Gray dashed | Value Area High — resistance zone |
| **VAL** | Gray dashed | Value Area Low — support zone |

**Action:**

- Price above VAH = overextended long
- Price below VAL = overextended short
- Trading between VAH/VAL = "fair value" range
