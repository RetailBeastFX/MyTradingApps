# RetailBeastFX Volume Companion v1.0 – Beast Mode Edition 🫧
**Release Date:** December 17, 2025

---

The perfect liquidity sidekick for RetailBeastFX v8.4 is here. Built on BigBeluga's proven volume visualizer, this companion transforms raw volume data into **actionable institutional footprint intelligence** – all tuned for 2025 ICT/SMC trading.

---

## 🔥 Major Highlight: Beast Mode Integration

**Beast Mode preset (default)** anchors everything to killzone sessions (London/NY + Silver Bullet) for maximum relevance.

Volume during killzones is **weighted 1.5x** when building the profile – HVNs now reflect real smart money activity windows, not diluted rolling data.

### One-Click Presets

| Preset | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **🔥 Beast Mode** | Killzone-focused, confluence-ready |
| **📈 Full Range** | Classic 200-bar rolling profile |
| **✨ Clean** | Bubbles only for minimal charts |
| **⚙️ Custom** | Full control |

---

## 🫧 Volume Bubbles – Institutional Push Detector

- Normalized volume bubbles sized by **standard deviations** (tiny → huge)
- Gradient coloring based on candle direction
- **Huge spikes labeled** with actual volume + golden glow during killzones = instant absorption/raid alerts
- **Golden background flash** on killzone volume surges (large/huge spikes)

---

## 💧 Liquidity Levels – Smart HVN Engine

- Dynamic horizontal **volume profile** with gradient boxes
- Strong **HVN lines** drawn only above threshold (default 30%) with variable thickness
- Optional **right extension** for future reference
- Extremes (range high/low) clearly labeled

---

## ⏰ Session-Aware Beast Features

- Full **London/NY/Silver Bullet** detection (EST timezone)
- **Highlight killzone nodes** option – makes Silver Bullet reversals pop
- Seamless pairing with RBFX v8.4 (same session logic, colors, timing)

---

## 🎨 Appearance & Performance

- Clean **offset profile** (default -50) to avoid chart clutter
- Bull/bear gradient colors matching RBFX aesthetic
- Efficient array management – **no lag, no repainting**

---

## 🔗 Why This Completes the System

| RBFX v8.4 | RBFX Volume |
|-----------|-------------|
| **The Structure** | **The Footprint** |
| OBs, FVGs, Suspension Blocks | Where volume clustered (HVNs) |
| BB extremes, ⭐ BEST SETUP signals | When institutions stepped in |
| SMC confluence zones | Confirmation of absorption during raids |

> **Together?** You see *what* smart money is doing (structure) and *how* they're doing it (volume footprint).

---

## 💀 The Bottom Line

**No more guessing if a rejection has conviction.**
Just high-probability, volume-confirmed confluence.
