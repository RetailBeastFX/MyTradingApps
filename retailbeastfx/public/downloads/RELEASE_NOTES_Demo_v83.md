# RetailBeastFX Demo v8.3 Release Notes
**Release Date:** December 15, 2025

---

## 🎯 Trinity Beast Mode Now Default

The Demo now ships with the same **disciplined defaults** as Premium — so you learn the right habits from day one.

---

## ✅ What's New

### 1. Bollinger Bands: 2.0 SD Default
- **Changed:** Deviation from `1.0` → `2.0`
- **Why:** 2.0 SD = 88-89% price containment. Only signals on **true statistical extremes**, not noise.

### 2. Killzone Signals Only: NEW Toggle
- **Added:** `Signals in Killzones Only` toggle (default: ON)
- **Why:** Signals only fire during London/NY killzones — highest probability windows only.

### 3. Signal Logic Enhanced
All signals (original BB + Alpha Edge strategies) now respect the killzone filter when enabled.
