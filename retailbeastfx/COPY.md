# RetailBeastFX Landing Page Copy - Hard Filter Version

**Implemented:** December 23, 2025  
**Purpose:** Transform site from optional-feeling to non-negotiable filtering mechanism

---

## 1. HERO SECTION (HARD GATE)

### Badge

**Tier-3 Execution Framework**

### Headline

**ONE SETUP. TWO SESSIONS.**  
**ZERO FLEXIBILITY.**

### Subhead

Retail Beast is a Tier-3 execution framework for traders who accept they cannot beat institutions on speed — and stop trying.

### Rule Lock (NO ICONS)

- Trade only London & New York killzones
- Trade only Trinity confluence (OB + BB 2.0 + EMA 8/21)
- Miss one condition → no trade

### CTA

Primary: **"See If You're Even Allowed to Trade This"**  
Secondary: **"View Requirements"**

---

## 2. EXCLUSION SECTION (FILTER)

### Headline

**THIS IS NOT FOR YOU IF —**

### Exclusion List

- × You need constant trades
- × You trade Asia or random hours
- × You want signals or alerts
- × You change rules after losses
- × You stack concepts to feel smart

### Closer

Retail Beast doesn't teach confidence.  
**It exposes whether you already have discipline.**

---

## 3. JOURNAL ENFORCEMENT

### Headline

**The Journal Is the Enforcer**

### Body Copy

**Every violation is logged. Every deviation is visible.**

You can't hide from your own behavior. The market doesn't forgive mistakes — the journal makes sure you don't forget them either.

---

## 4. THE OATH (FINAL GATE)

### Headline

**THE RETAIL BEAST OATH**

### Oath Text

I will not trade without confluence.  
I will not trade outside killzones.  
I will not bend rules to feel better.

### Tagline

**No trade. No debate. No cope.**

### CTA

**Enter Under These Rules**

---

## DESIGN NOTES

**What Changed:**

- Removed all icons from rule bullets
- Hard left-border styling (green/red) for rules
- Permission-based CTAs (not hype)
- Monospace-style discipline tone

**Conversion Strategy:**
This creates a filtering funnel: **Hook → Filter → Enforce → Commit**

Casual traders bounce at Exclusion.  
Disciplined traders lock in at The Oath.

---

**The System demands perfection. No setup, no shot.**
