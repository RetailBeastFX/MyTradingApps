## 🔥 Beast Mode Edition

This release transforms RetailBeastFX into an **institutional-grade SMC trading cockpit** with one-click presets and battle-tested defaults.

### New Preset System
Select your trading style instantly:

| Preset | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **🔥 Beast Mode** | High-prob killzone setups only – Gold/USDJPY/NAS100 optimized |
| **📈 Swing Trader** | 24/7 trading with HTF bias focus |
| **✨ Clean Chart** | Minimal visuals – just BB, EMAs, signals |
| **⚙️ Custom** | Your personal configuration |

### Beast Mode Defaults
The indicator now loads with the **proven high-probability configuration**:

| Setting | Beast Mode Value |
|---------|-----------------|
| Trading Mode | SCALPER |
| Strategy Style | Off (pure BB signals) |
| Killzone Filter | ON |
| OB Min Consecutive | 2+ |
| Suspension Blocks | ON |
| Silver Bullet Zone | ON |
| Liquidity Sweeps | ON |
| HTF Confluence | ON (1H) |
| Fractal Filter | ON |
| Display Mode | Present |

> **Why these defaults?** This configuration aggressively filters for confluence: BB extremes + HTF proximity + killzone timing + Suspension Blocks. Designed for scalpers/day traders who want fewer, higher-quality setups with monster R:R.
